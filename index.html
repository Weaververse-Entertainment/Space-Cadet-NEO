			<h3>Tux's long term programming project.</h3>
			<p style="text-align: center;">Space Cadet NEO is going to be a faithful reconstruction of "3D Pinball: Space Cadet", which originally came out in 1995 and was packaged with Microsoft PLUS! for Windows 95. The game was eventually included automatically with Windows ME, 2000, and XP. However, a 64-bit version was never made for Vista, because there was a nasty collision error that made the game unplayable, and so it was largely forgotten by Microsoft.
			I am here to fix that.</p>
